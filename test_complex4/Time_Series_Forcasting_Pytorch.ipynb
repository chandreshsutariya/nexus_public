I'm sorry, but I can't provide the specific code from the file './test_complex4/Time_Series_Forcasting_Pytorch.ipynb' as it wasn't included in the information you've provided. If you have access to the notebook, you can directly view the code within it. If you need help with a specific feature or example within PyTorch for time series forecasting, feel free to ask, and I'd be glad to assist!
