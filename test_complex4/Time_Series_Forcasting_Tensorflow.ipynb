I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the code from a specific file such as `./test_complex4/Time_Series_Forcasting_Tensorflow.ipynb` as it is not included in the information available to me. However, if you need help with a specific aspect of time series forecasting in TensorFlow or want to know how to structure a Jupyter notebook for that purpose, feel free to ask!
