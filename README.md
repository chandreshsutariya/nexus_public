## Tools & Libraries
- In this step, the app will suggest tools and libraries that can be used for the development of your project.
- The suggestions will be generated based on your project’s scope and complexity.
- Go to the Tools & Libraries option, tap the 'Regenerate' button, and wait for a moment.
- example : 
        
        1. Frontend Development:
        - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for designing the web interface.
        - React.js or Vue.js for building the user interface.
        - Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.

        2. Backend Development:
        - Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic.
        - Python with Flask or Django if you prefer Python for the backend.

        3. Weather Data API:
        - OpenWeatherMap API, Weatherstack, or Weather API to fetch real-time weather data.

## Panel
- Here, the user will receive the panels needed for the project.
- Go to the Panels option, tap the 'Regenerate' button, and wait for the results.
- The app will consider the scope of your project and suggest appropriate panels.
- example : 

        1. User Panel:
        - Weather Forecast Overview
        - Location-Based Weather Information
        - Weather Alerts and Notifications
        - User Account Management (Login/Logout, Profile)

## Task Planning 
- This is one of the most crucial steps.
- It will use the project's description to divide the entire project into sub-tasks.
- The tasks will include everything needed to develop the project.
- To run this, go to the Task Planning section and tap the 'Regenerate' button.
- Afterward, the user can review the generated tasks and easily remove any task by tapping the ❌ icon next to it.
- example : 

        1. [UI/UX] Design the homepage layout to display current weather conditions using wireframe tools and mockups.
        2. [API] Develop an API endpoint to fetch current weather data from external weather service.
        3. [DB] Set up a database to store user preferences and historical weather data for analytics.
        4. [SECURITY] Implement input validation on location data to avoid injections and erroneous data submissions.

## Project Setup 
- In this step, the app will use the project's description and any input provided by the user to generate the results.
- To run this, tap the 'Regenerate' button, enter any specific input you’d like to provide, or simply type 'generate', and then click the 'Generate' button.
- By using user input, you can control the output according to your preferences.
- This option will provide a directory structure and instructions for setting up the project.
- example : 

        weather-website/
        │
        ├── frontend/                     # Frontend application

        │
        ├── data/                         # Folder for storing fetched weather data or API responses (optional)
        │
        ├── .gitignore                    # Main Git ignore file for the project
        └── README.md                     # Project documentation
        

        Instructions to Set Up:

        1. Create the Main Project Folder:
        - Create a folder named `weather-website`.
        2. Frontend Setup:
        - Inside the main folder, create a subfolder named `frontend` and initialize a React or Vue project (using Create React App or Vue CLI).
        - Add the necessary directories and files as indicated above.

        3. Backend Setup:
        - Create another subfolder named `backend`.
        - Set up a Node.js application with Express or a Python application with Flask/Django.
        - Add the necessary directories and files as indicated.

## Note
- The user input feature can be used to tailor the output to the user's satisfaction. 
- If the user is not satisfied with the result, they can specify the changes they want in the user input field, click the 'Generate' button, and the updated results will be displayed.

---

## WARNING 
- Before proceeding to the kickoff module to download the project, make sure it-File structure- contains every file required for your project development.
- If any file is missing, copy the current directory structure, paste in the text input field for regenerating, and along with pasted file structure - write the changes that you want in that file structure, and tap the 'Generate' button.

For example:

    ```
    Keep the directory structure the same, just add 'FILE-Name with location' into the structure and provide me with the complete, detailed updated directory structure.
    ```
