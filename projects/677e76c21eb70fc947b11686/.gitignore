```gitignore
# Flutter/Dart

.flutter-plugins
.flutter-plugins-dependencies
pubspec.lock
build/
ios/Flutter/.last_build_id
ios/Flutter/App.framework
ios/Flutter/Flutter.framework
ios/Flutter/Flutter.podspec
android/.gradle/
android/app/build/

*.lock

# VS Code settings
.vscode/

# IDE specific
.idea/
*.sublime-workspace
*.sublime-project
*.xcodeproj/
*.xcworkspace/

podfile.lock
```

Make sure to include this file in your project's root directory to effectively manage which files should be ignored by Git.
